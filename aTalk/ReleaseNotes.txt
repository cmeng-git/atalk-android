Project aTalk-Android Release Notes
=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.6 (209061)
Release Date:   07/19/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Allow recipient to cancel incoming file offer in progress after user has accepted the offer (esp large file).
- Fix aTalk crashes when sender cancels outgoing file offer:
  Must update mState in JingleFileTransferImpl#mState JingleOutgoingFileOffer, similar to JingleIncomingFileOffer;
  else mState is null when sender cancel() the outgoing file offer transfer.
- Sender cancels outgoing file offer is not handled at recipient side for JFT protocol.
  Must init IncomingFileTransferJingleImpl() immediately on new IncomingFileOfferJingleImpl(); and not on user accept (too late).
  i.e. perform JingleSessionImpl.addJingleSessionListener(this), to receive the cancel event sent by remote sender.
- Solution: Add FileTransfer#onPrepare() method to setup to receive remote incoming file transfer event before
  user accept file; and modify the acceptFile() declaration/definition.
- Must fire cancel event when sender cancels the jingle file transfer prior to sending to update send UI properly; OutgoingFileOfferJingleImpl#onCanceled()
- FileSendConversation: Send sender canceled file transfer message to remote, only for legacy FT mode. Jingle FT has its own protocol control.
- FileTransferConversation: Allow send file retry option for sender only.
- FileTransferConversation#updateFileViewInfo(): Do not attempt MyGlideApp.loadImage() if an existed file has length 0.
- Ensure JingleSessionImpl.removeJingleSessionListener(this) for IncomingFileTransferJingleImpl#onError() and onSessionTerminated()
- Add cases state for ended handling in JingleFileTransferImpl#cancel();
  when user cancels while the file transfer has ended in JingleIncomingFileOffer#onBytestreamReady().
- File transfer with thumbnail supported feature missing
  ProtocolProviderServiceJabberImpl: Add supportedFeatures.add(BoBIQ.NAMESPACE); // XEP-0231: Bits of Binary
- ChatStateManager#INCOMING_CHAT_STATE_FILTER must include FromTypeFilter.ENTITY_FULL_JID to filter messages/chatState send from server
- Roll back FileTransferStatusChangeEvent#FINISHED to use #COMPLETED instead for easy handling
- MetaContactChatTransport#getStatus() return higher threshold of the two i.e. contactResource or contact when checking isOnline()
- ChatPanel#updateCacheFTRecord(): cacheMsg.getMessageUID() can be null; interchange compare order
- ChatFragment#chat_message_del case: isSafeDel <= Not safe to delete the tmp file, it may be used for multiple send instances
- Add support to cancel showToastMessage for fast update mode.
- upgrade smack library to use v4.4.6

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.5 (209050)
Release Date:   06/14/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Implement call waiting to accept a second incoming call by placing the in-progress call on hold; and allow switching between calls.
- Fix Jingle File Transfer failure due to NPE exception: JingleContentImpl.setParent(JingleContentImpl) where parent may be null causing NullPointerException.
- Launch OMEMO device verification dialog for any Undecided Omemo Identity during Jingle File Transfer/JET session
- Fix previous local video state is not properly restored on return from chat. Need to start content-modify onResume
  Error get introduced in v2.8.0 when migrating to camera2 implementation
- Change CallPeerJabberImpl#sendModifyVideoContent() to only perform below if there is an actual video content changes
  mediaHandler.reinitContent(remoteContentName, content, false);
  mediaHandler.start(); else this get executed twice in #processSessionAccept()
- Fix content-add video to existing audio call in progress not working.
  Agent#scheduleTermination() when audio call has completed setup;
  IceUdpTransportManager#startConnectivityEstablishment() not proceed: ice4j ConnectivityCheckClient#startChecks must init stopped = false;
- VideoHandlerFragment.doAlignRemoteVideo(VideoHandlerFragment.java:736);
  remoteVideoView must be an orphan before assigned to another ViewGroup parent; else exception i.e.
  The specified child already has a parent. You must call removeView() on the child's parent first.
- Fix legacy incoming call being treated as JingleMessageSession call and display incorrect UI to user.
  This happen when there was a JingleMessageSession call previously.
  Change AndroidCallListener#onCallEvent() to check for jingle sid instead of mRemote (not clear)
- Fix long pause during login process and call setup at time, caused by dnsQuery using inactive network.
  Modify AndroidUsingLinkProperties#getDnsServerAddresses(0 to ensure only activeNetwork is returned to caller.
- Unable to override Duration in PeriodicRunnable#Duration getDelayUntilNextRun()
  so revert: update ice4j from org.jitsi:ice4j:3.0-55-g32a8aad to org.jitsi:ice4j:3.0-60-g28a23e1
- Fix QuerryContactListAdapter#getChildrenCount() and #getChild() ArrayOutOfBound exception
- Update libvpx to latest github source 013ec57 (20220614)
- Move jinglenodes classes into smack directory structure

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.4 (209040)
Release Date:   05/14/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Add support for XEP-0251: Jingle Session Transfer in Unattended and Attended call transfer:
  https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0251.html#unattended XEP-0251 § 2. Unattended Transfer
  https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0251.html#attended XEP-0251 § 3. Attended Transfer
  Clean up SdpTransfer and SdpTransferred implementation, and included support in JingleCallSessionImpl,
- CallNotificationManager must handle multiple instances for call transfer; using requestBase for alternate Notification
- Correct typo error in processJingle() case i.e. security_info => session_info during migration
- Add handler in OperationSetBasicTelephonyJabberImpl to report any Jingle Responder error return by remote
  https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html#protocol-response
- Change Network Security Configuration to disallow the use of user-specified certificates. This could allow eavesdroppers to intercept data sent by aTalk, or to modify data in transit.
- ANR on ChatPanel#messageDelivered() & #addMessage() due to synchronized(cacheLock); modify source to minimize deadlock (hold time)
- Change DialogActivity#alert_dialog layout, background color and with border
- Ensure DTLS security state is properly updated when returning to video call UI;
  DtlsControlImpl#getSecureCommunicationStatus() must return with a proper securityState as set by secureOnOff().

- Upgrade aTalk jni libraries for:
 a. openssl-1.1.1k => openssl-1.1.1n
 b. ffmpeg-4.4 to ffmpeg-4.4.2
 c  x264-161.3049 to libx264-163.3060
 d. libvpx from 1.10.0 to 1.11.0 (main)

- fix libvpx scripts errors for libvpx
- Rename ffmpeg-x264#ini_update_libs.sh to init_libs_ffmpeg_x264.sh, and corrected script errors for x264 library download
- Remove requests for permission.GET_ACCOUNTS and permission.MANAGE_ACCOUNTS in aTalk

- ToDo: difficult to reproduce
  * CallPeerMediaHandlerJabberImpl.getTransportManager() => The initiator is expected to specify the transport in their offer when remote terminate call before setup

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.3 (209031)
Release Date:   04/23/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Redesign JingleMessageSession class to ensure all incoming/outgoing call are handled properly via JingleManager listeners callback
  Rename JingleMessageHelper => JingleMessageSessionImpl and its implementation for JingleCall incoming/outgoing call handling
- Must send JingleMessage retract to close the loop, when user ends the call prior to jingle session-initiate being send
- Avoid sending trailing Jingle stanza once JingleSession Handler has unregistered with JingleManager
- Register JingleSession Handler callback with JingleManager only on sending Jingle session-initiate, to ensure proper cleanup when call end.
  Must let CallPeerJabberImpl#initiateSession() perform JingleCallSessionImpl() as an session initiator (outgoing call);
  else JingleManager#unregisterJingleSessionHandler() is not performed when user end call before session-initiate
- Resolve cross dependency between smack-extensions and smack-experimental (for pull request)
- Fix CallJabberImpl.getConference() on a null object reference
  => MediaAwareCall#getConference() may return null if call terminated before setup completed
- Fix problem with android camera2 API implementation in throwing waitForFreeSlotThenRelock on fast android devices.
  Set ImageReader.newInstance maxImage = 3 and use acquireLatestImage().
  BufferQueueProducer: [ImageReader-1280x720](id:2c3200000026,api:4,p:733,c:11314) waitForFreeSlotThenRelock: timeout [mDequeueTimeout=1000ms
- Drop android API support to API-31; API-32 contains no source for development debug.

- ======= JNI libraries update =======
- Use python3 for all scripts in Jni libraries build
- Update libvpx version to 1.11.0 (not stable, so stays at 1.10.0)

- ======= Fix FFR for <= 2.9.1 (20220422) =======
- Fix NoSuchElementException: May happen when user omemo DB is yet to be setup.
    at java.util.TreeSet.first (TreeSet.java:394)
    at org.atalk.crypto.omemo.SQLiteOmemoStore.purgeUserOmemoData (SQLiteOmemoStore.java:973)
- Fix IndexOutOfBoundsException: if child contact may have been removed
    at java.util.ArrayList.get (ArrayList.java:437)
    at org.atalk.android.gui.contactlist.model.QueryContactListAdapter.getChild (QueryContactListAdapter.java:157)
- Fix NulPointerException: NPE??? just move into try/catch loop
    at org.atalk.crypto.omemo.OmemoAuthenticateDialog.onCreate (OmemoAuthenticateDialog.java:118)

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.2 (209020)
Release Date:   04/14/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Add support for XEP-0234: Jingle File Transfer (In-Band and SOCK5 Bytestreams), with new packages or classes added:
  jingle_filetransfer, IncomingFileOfferJingleImpl, InformingFileTransferJingleImpl, OutgoingFileOfferJingleImpl
  and jingle package add adapter, callbacks, components, exception, and update transport etc
  https://github.com/vanitasvitae/Smack/tree/jingle3/smack-experimental/src/main/java/org/jivesoftware/smackx/jingle_filetransfer
- Add support for XEP-0391: Jingle Encrypted Transports; supporting OMEMO encryption in Jingle File Transfer.
  new packages/classes: ciphers, jet, update omemo with jet support; see https://blog.jabberhead.tk/summer-of-code-2017/
  Note: conversation advertised JET but not following xmpp process flow; fallback to use HttpFileUpload for next 10 files transfer
- Fallback to HttpFileUpload if JetSecurity is not fully supported by client e.g. conversations.
- aTalk file transfer handling priority (see MetaContactChatTransport): (online) jingle file transfer with JET
  => (online) legacy file transfer => (offline and fallback) HttpFileUpload
- Display detailed reason text for file transfer failure status to user.
- Rename file transfer 'refused' to 'declined', same as in Jingle File Transfer implementation.
- Migrate aTalk telephony jingle stanza handling to use smack JingleManager implementation structure: include BasicTelephony interface
  and add JingleCallManager, JingleCallSessionImpl classes to register with JingleManager for jingle session callbacks.
- Add JmStateListener interface (JingleMessageType) to JingleMessageHelper; allowing OperationSetBasicTelephonyJabberImpl
  to make earlier registerJingleSessionHandler() with JingleManager as to avoid problem with incoming call from conversations.
  see https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-5-jingle-manager-implementation-has-problem-to-handle-conversations-incoming-call/91573
- Allow accept and display the location map based on geo location message from other android devices e.g. conversations.
- Cleanup jarjar.repackage for ice4j:3.0-55-g32a8aad.
- Remove dependencies.gradle in android-youtube-player plug in; only use in one gradle.build.
- Add XMPP version information to all reference in About UI.

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.1 (209010)
Release Date:   03/16/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Upgrade ice4j to use org.jitsi:ice4j:3.0-55-g32a8aad with aTalk customization
- Android with network APN=IPv4/IPv6 or APN=IPv6 returns only IPv6 public address in InetAddress.getByName(host);
  hence only an IPv6 candidate (without the sfllx candidate) is sent i.e.
  i.e. IPv6 candidate harvested from ice4j HostCandidateHarvester#harvest(); causing problem in call setup;
  <candidate port='58979' type='host' ip='2401:7400:4000:2e4a:1:2:93f1:b634' id='e49ea0a0-87e9-46a1-9c2e-1666b6ce8e32'/>
  missing: <candidate ... ip='119.56.100.180' port='5002' type='srflx' rel-addr='10.143.27.57' rel-port='5002' network='0'/>
  Problem fixed with IceUdpTransportManager#getTransportAddress(String hostname, int port, Transport transport)
  see https://github.com/jitsi/ice4j/issues/255 for detail problem and solution.
  For android network APN setting see: https://sanctum9.wordpress.com/2019/03/15/switch-to-ipv6-on-android/
- upgrade smack library to use v4.4.5

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.0a (209001)
Release Date:   03/09/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Use GoogleMap latest Renderer: MapsInitializer.initialize(getApplicationContext(), Renderer.LATEST, this);
- Update implementation for deprecated Sensor.TYPE_ORIENTATION with Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER and Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD
- Remove unused ApiLib; Implemented functions are available since API-19
- Update MediaAwareCallPeer, MediaStreamStats2 and StatisticsEngine; add skipStats option i.e. statistics sending
- Port ice4j 3.0-55-g32a8aad source into ice4j 2.0; see gradle has problem handling both com.github compile and jarjar at the same time:
  java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: No static method decode([BCC)Lorg/ice4j/message/Message; (2.9.0a is still having this problem)
- Migration apache httpclient5:5.1 to okhttp3:okhttp:4.9.3: Upgrade HttpUtils and add HttpConnectionManager
  * okhttp 4.x handles redirect and authentication; see https://square.github.io/okhttp/features/calls/#follow-up-requests
  HttpUtils not tested (used by CertificateServiceImpl & ProvisioningServiceImpl);
  Both classes are not active in aTalk; need more work when deploy.
- Clear up smack jingle java document

=========================================================================
Version:        2.9.0 (209000)
Release Date:   02/28/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Replace deprecated LifecycleObserver with LifecycleEventObserver in android-youtube-player
- Update deprecated ConnectivityManager in android-youtube-player
- Use NetworkCallBack in place of deprecated Broadcast Receiver in android-youtube-player
- Must use runOnUiThread for ChatActivity#localUserPresenceChanged(LocalUserChatRoomPresenceChangeEvent)
  triggered by ChatRoomJabberImpl#onJoinSuccess()
- Hide video call option if the android device does not have camera support
- Enhance aTalk media call handler to support conversations media call unique implementation:
  a. sending leading/trailing single candidate per transport-info stanza; in both session-initiate or session-accept instance
  b. sending candidates for both RTP and RTCP with rtcp-mux option enabled; to cater for non rtcp-mux callee
  @See https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/issues/4285
  Still having problem as responder in sending audio, even Pair validated: 192.168.1.167:5009/udp/host -> 192.168.1.37:33079/udp/host (audio.RTP)
  No found for Selected pair for stream audio.RTP: the problem seems to be from conversation no sending nominationConfirmed for aTalk validated audio candidate i.e.
  Response from conversations indicates that we have received a response to a request that either contained the <tt>USE-CANDIDATE</tt> attribute
  #sendHolePunchPacket: Error cannot send to remote peer for media: AUDIO; MediaStreamTarget with dataAddress null and controlAddress null
  see: https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/issues/4285 & https://github.com/iNPUTmice/Conversations/issues/4287
- Conversations implementation: JingleContent.Name <> RtpDescription.getMedia()
  CallJabberImpl.#processSessionInitiate(): must get mediaType from RtpDescription.getMedia() instead of JingleContent.getName();
  conversations JingleContent.getName() does not contain mediaType
- Must check callPeer not null before proceed processJingleSynchronize#transport_info case;
  Caller prematurely terminated call clear the callPeer or transport-info sent before session-initiate.
- ice44j pending on android devices API version has problem handling a mixed for ip4 and ip6 public address - need more work.
  e.g. Note10 aTalk send public ip in IPV6 format, old device cannot handle IPV6 address, hence failed.
- Clean up JavaDoc for all java classes
- Major changes to all jingle classes with two new implemented base classes
  i.e. AbstractXmlElement and Default XmlElementProvider using builder approach

=========================================================================
Version:        2.8.1 (208010)
Release Date:   01/18/2022
Author:         cmeng
- Enhance Call History UI to allow deletion of records order than the specified timestamp i.e. CALL_START
- Check to ensure chatRoom creation cannot have subject set to null (smack 4.4.4 Bookmarks assert value != null)
- Change FilePathHelper#getRealPath to use MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA to retrieve filePath disregard of the content type
- Cleanup DialogActivity for all other modules to refer to; remove all unused dialog functions in AndroidUtils.
- Allow download and install/reinstall the debug apk for the new or same version
- Change downloaded apk path to ./aTalk/tmp to auto create new apk filename if exist; else FilePathHelper#getFilePathWithCreate() will keep old apk file if exit
- Upgrade build to support android API-32
- Remove RandomUtils.java #secureRandomBytes() class and use  RandomUtil#fillWithSecureRandom(key);
- Purge unused SurfaceTextureManager class
- Move all xmpp directories and files into org.jivesoftware.smackx structure in preparation for future jingle features enhancements
- Fix (if possible) all Crash/ANR cases from FFR prior to v2.8.0

=========================================================================
Version:        2.8.0 (208000)
Release Date:   12/22/2021
Author:         cmeng
- Migrate to use android Camera2 API replacing deprecated Camera API
- Enhance remote video streaming handling to give higher frame rate and smoother display transition when sending device is rotated
- Fix remote video playback view in full screen when media call is started with device in landscape mode; see RemoteVideoLayout
- Improve remote video handler to avoid unintentionally removing the remoteVideoContainer view, causing display disruption
- Init camera parameters even when aTalk is in background mode - CameraManager has no such restrictions with Camera2 implementation

- Fixed both VP8/VP9 DePacketizer causing problem in AndroidCodec i.e.
  // int outputBufferIdx = codec.dequeueOutputBuffer(mBufferInfo, 0);
  // int inputBufferIdx = codec.dequeueInputBuffer(0);
  // ReSync the firstSeq if process has dropped out data; must do this else MediaCodec decode has the above problems
  * else if (RTPUtils.sequenceNumberComparator.compare(inSeq, firstSeq) > 0) {
        firstSeq = inSeq;
    }

- Disable user selectable 'use direct surface option' for android hardware decoder/encoder option:
  * Note: Current aTalk implementation requires direct surface option to be enabled in order
  * for fmj to use the android codec if enabled. So couple both the surface and codec options
  * FMJ will pick software decoder preference over hardware decode if isDirectSurfaceEnabled == false
  * FMJ will pick software encoder preference over hardware encoder if isDirectSurfaceEnabled == false
  * Both android encoder and decoder required aTalk restart to take effect if codec enable state changed

- Fixed android decoder problem using SurfaceView:
  * VideoHandlerFragment#doAlignRemoteVideo(); RemoteVideoLayout => preferredSizeChanged
  * Render the buffer with the default timestamp: Call releaseOutputBuffer(bufferId, true).
    see https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaCodec
- Fixed android encoder using SurfaceView
  * Merged SurfaceManager into SurfaceStream
  * Camera2 requires mSurfaceTexture.updateTexImage() to be executed in onFrameAvailable() thread

- Must check if the selected androidCodec is supported by the device when hardware encode is enabled
  * https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats#video-formats
  * AndroidEncoder#SUPPORTED_OUTPUT_FORMATS() depends on device capability.
  * see VideoMediaStreamImpl#selectVideoSize(DataSource, int, int)
- AndroidEncoder#configureMediaCodec(); need only to consider inputFormat for video size
  and taken into account in MediaFormat.createVideoFormat() pending device orientation (streaming video aspect ratio)
- Alert user on hardware codec init problem if any (when codec is not supported)

- Implement AbstractFormatControl#setFormat() as per JMF doc and cleanup the extended classes
  https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17802_01/j2se/javase/technologies/desktop/media/jmf/2.1.1/apidocs/javax/media/control/FormatControl.html

- CameraStreamBase#MFormat: must use a clone copy of the reference format given in streamFormats[];
  i.e. mFormat = (VideoFormat) streamFormats[0].clone();
  otherwise mFormat.setVideoSize(mPreviewSize) will change the actual item in the formatControl.getSupportedFormats();
  causing problem in VideoMediaStreamImpl#selectVideoSize() to fail with no matched items, and androidCodec to work on first instance only

- Replace deprecated LifecycleObserver with LifecycleEventObserver in aTalkApp
- The user selected video capture device for media recorder is not retrieved properly
  Fix DeviceConfiguration#extractConfiguredVideoCaptureDevice() checking algorithm
- Disable MediaRecorder support for aTalk;
  after android API 23, android drops support for non-seekable file descriptors i.e. mediaRecorder.setOutputFile(createLocalSocket());

- ChatPanel#mergeCachedMessage must take care of outOfBound Index, else ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
- Adapt AndroidUIServiceImpl#getSize to cater for different android API, to avoid system crash.
- Add playback speed support to AudioBgService class; UI currently not implemented.
- Move MediaCodecs info setting into Expert settings preference screen.

- Relocate all java/javax classes to its original location - no relocation required for fmj (AS linker not further throw duplication)
- Upgrade smack to version 4.4.4
- Upgrade build to support android-12(s) i.e. API-31

  // ReSync the firstSeq if process has dropped out data; must do this else MediaCodec decode has the above problems
  * else if (RTPUtils.sequenceNumberComparator.compare(inSeq, firstSeq) > 0) {
        firstSeq = inSeq;

Version:        2.6.4 (206040)
Release Date:	08/21/2021
Author:         cmeng
- Ensure proper handling of all file transfer types when the chat history logging is disabled
  * Need major changes to all the fileTransfer classes and FileHistoryServiceImpl.
  * ChatPanel#msgCache must be updated when file transfer status changes, else resume will use old FT status
  * Improve the way the history record are being retrieved and merged with msgCache
  * Cannot just clear msgCache under all circumstances; else will loss all history logged messages
- Fix new chat session messages get clear on resume, when:
    a. a file transfer activity has occurred.
    b. a message records are deleted
    c. on delivery receipt return
- Fix chat messages view is not properly updated when history chat messages are being fetched on user scrolling up.
  Must update msgView text when no html tag is being processed, revert msgView.setText(msgBody) as it was accidentally removed in v2.5.0
- Ensure file transfer status is consistently being reported even after resume from chat session closed.
- Two consecutive FT History messages should not be merged into one display message; else the second media file will not be shown
- Remove unused youtubeExtractor implementation
- Upgrade AS build to be compatible with JavaVersion.VERSION_11 => give problem so aborted
- upgrade 'org.osgi:osgi.core:8.0.0' - need new implementation for abstract method adapt(Class type)

=========================================================================
Version:        2.6.3 (206030)
Release Date:	07/17/2021
Author:         cmeng
- Upgrade smack libraries to version 4.4.3 release
- Upgrade opus to version 1.3.1, and add init_libopus.sh to fetch online source instead of svn check-in;
  clean up opus/Android.mk script; need to run init_libopus.h as source is not checked in
- Upgrade speex to version 1.2.0, and ogg to v1.3.5; speex 1.2.0 removed the resampler etc supports
  hence need to add missing files, needed by aTalk from speex-1.2beta3 (rc1);
  add init_libSpeexOgg.sh to fetch online sources for both speex-1.2beta3  and instead of svn check-in;
- Run gradle task 'getJniLibs' to fetch these jni libraries prior to android ndk build process.
  These libraries sources include: opus, speex and ogg

Version:        2.6.2 (206020)
Release Date:	07/08/2021
Author:         cmeng
- Implement android youtube player using IFrame Player API to avoid video link extraction error
- Support youtube playlist playback i.e. Fallback to use as playlist if youtube url load failed.
- Use fragment for exoPlayer and youtubePlayer playback, allowing user page sliding or text entry
- Add support for VP9 codec support in media call
  * VP9 decoder; problem due to incorrect calculation of the VP9 Payload Descriptor data size
  * VP9 encoder:
    cfg.g_lag_in_frames = 0 to avoid lag in frames (25 buffer frames) delay
    cfg.g_threads = 1; codec control VP8E_SET_CPUUSED >= 7 for realtime video application; other encoder is not working
    should not use lossless mode for realtime video application
    create VP9PayloadDescriptor uncompressed header for start of frame etc
  * need to apply patches for v1.10.0 i.e. vpx_encode.h for vp9 encode to work
- AbstractCodec2#Process() must update inputFormat when there is a change in inputBuffer data; for vp9Encoder to handle device rotation
- Base on MessageHistoryActivator to getMessageHistoryService() instead of AndroidGUIActivator to avoid null reference;
- Not supported by camera preview, so omit: Add (800x450)camera resolution option for user selection;
  instead set (1280720) as default resolution
- Rewrite vpx_jni file, using marco and remove .h file for future ease of maintenance.
- Update jni/static_library_build script so all jni libraries are updated only if not found or version incorrect
- gradle task defined for building the jni static libraries for ffmpeg-x264, vpx and openssl
- FFmpeg must be compiled with the --enable-libvpx option for VP9 to work (but does not help in aTalk vp9 encode/decode)
  see https://developers.google.com/media/vp9/get-started

Version:        2.6.0 (206000)
Release Date:	04/05/2021
Author:         cmeng
- Check for user valid ipAddress entry in STUN/TURN setting configuration
- Cancel vibrator immediately upon call accepted by user i.e. JingleMessageHelper.sendJingleAccept()
  and showToast message "Connecting caller" on received JingleProceed message
- Remove ProgressDialogFragment.showProgressDialog() in AndroidCallUtil#createCall(). Does not have chance to display and
  often have error in DialogActivity.waitForDialogOpened(dialogId), leaving an un-closeable (by user) dialog fragment
- Android throws the following error when camera resolution is set to 720x480 in portrait mode;
  522240 is for landscape size calculated by by PreviewStream#calcYV12Size:
  E/Camera-JNI: Callback buffer was too small! Expected 522240 bytes, but got 518400 bytes!
  Reason: aTalk always set to use landscape (0 deg) in camera preview; see PreviewStream#calcYV12Size()
- Default enable VP8 codec and set as first priority. Default video resolution to "720x480"
- RemoteVideoLayout#setVideoPreferredSize() Size change algorithm must use preferredSize and videoSize ratio compare;
  Otherwise, not null remoteVideoView will also return false for sizeChange when remote video dimension changes
  due to device orientation change; removed this test as it is unnecessary.

======== Video call with device orientation change ==========
Three approaches: #3 is selected for final implementation to give the best result:
1: In VideoCallActivity#onCreate, use setRequestedOrientation(ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_XXX)
   When sender changes orientation, recipient needs to change his device orientation to make the remote video view upright -> then sender remote view becomes OK.
   The video stream encryption with Replay protect should work properly as there is not interruption in stream sending.
   However when switch to back camera, the remote video is inverted. Both sender & recipient must switch to back cameras to work properly.
2. Approach aborted due to complexity and NewReceiveStreamEvent is not always gets triggered - reliability issue
   Do not send content-modify when the sender device orientation change as there is no change in senders attribute.
   see https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html#def-action-content-modify
   The content-modify action is used to change the direction of an existing content definition through modification of the 'senders' attribute.
3. Use VideoActivity#onConfigurationChanged() event, and let app handles all the required changes i.e.
   a. Local content view redraw
   b. Need to check camera rotation; front/back to correctly transform video data for streaming; to avoid stretch and orientation
   b. Rotated camera preview sending, requires recipient CODEC to auto detect video stream size change. Currently only VP8 can support

======== Video call with camera switching ==========
- see PreviewStream#switchCamera(); release current camera and start user selected camera.
  # MediaStreamImpl#setDevice: remove check for device change in "if ((deviceSession == null) || (deviceSession.getDevice() != device))"
  # Seems not necessary after the above change, so reinsert back:
    Block DeviceConfiguration#setVideoCaptureDevice to firePropertyChange(VIDEO_CAPTURE_DEVICE, oldDevice, device);
    to avoid triggering of JIngle messages (content modify) sending

- The above two new implementations should improve SRTP replay protection reliability on screen rotation or switching camera

- The H.264 encoder and decoder are now extended with AbstractCodec2; and cleanup VPX codec
- H.264 codec cannot dynamically obtain remote video dimension, hence cannot support auto rotate remote view container: JNIDecoder#doProcess()
- Note: this is not required if using method #1 implementation; but show corrupted display for method #3 implementation.

- Port to fmj-1.0.1-jitsi.jar: only minor changes in pom.xml (no change in source)
- Upgrade to smack 4.4.2 release:
  * Remove jarjar smack-core (aTalk): omit AbstractProvider.java and Function.java classes in aTalk source
  * Port aTalk BoBExt and BoBExtensionProvider to use smack BoBDataExtension and BoBDataExtensionProvider respectively
- JCenter deprecation and end of service: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/jcenter-migration

=========================================================================
Version:        2.3.0 (1130)
Release Date:	06/15/2020
Author:         cmeng
- Remove 'Miss Call Notification' option from android notification channel; miss call is controlled via 'Call Notification'
- Add popup notification option for NotificationManager.CALL_SECURITY_ERROR event independent of SECURITY_MESSAGE
  * AndroidPopup: subCategorized mSmallIcon for WARNING_MESSAGE_TYPE, MISSED_CALL_MESSAGE_TYPE and Others e.g. SECURITY_MESSAGE
  * PopupMessageNotificationHandlerImpl: int messageType
- Do not fire missed call notifications if user dismissed the call:
  CallPeerJabberImpl#hangup with reason code set to CallPeerChangeEvent.NORMAL_CALL_CLEARING

- Show heads-up notification for an incoming message only if aTalk is in background.

- Move NotificationHelper() init to aTalkApp onCreate, so to get ready earlier to avoid RemoteServiceException:
  Bad notification for startForeground: RuntimeException: invalid channel for service notification:
  Notification(channel=default pri=0 contentView=null vibrate=null sound=null defaults=0x0 flags=0x60 color=0x00000000 vis=PRIVATE semFlags=0x0 semPriority=0 semMissedCount=0)

- Fix call problem with pidgin v2.13.0 having improper implementation sending 4 instances <jingle xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:1' action='session-accept'..>
  * CallPeerJabberImpl#processSessionAccept(): accept only first one and ignore all others; otherwise creates havoc in aTalk i.e.:
  * a. Accidentally stopZrtp() because of new audio stream (new accept), and this will clear all zrtp setup e.g. zrtpEngine == null (NPE)
  * b. VideoActivity#doFinishActivity() does not hangup call properly and the send stream remains active even after call end
  * c. Android system volume get stuck in call setOutputVolumeControl(audioStream, call) settings

- Implement XEP-0353: Jingle Message Initiation: https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0353.htm
  Block and skip handling of any incoming delayed Jingle Messages
- Use common Jingle session id for Jingle <propose/>, session-initiate, and media Call etc for easy handling of call notifications and actions
- Add new CallState#CALL_AUTO_ANSWER to handle call via Jingle Message Initiation.
- Add PopupMessage#EvenType - the type of the event that the popup message for for better handling of the various popup messages.
- Add new message type to SystrayService i.e. MISSED_CALL_MESSAGE_TYPE, JINGLE_INCOMING_CALL and JINGLE_INCOMING_CALL
- Add CallState.CALL_AUTO_ANSWER action in CallListener class to handle Jingle Message Accept and future auto-answer support.
- Change VideoCallActivity property to allow launching when device is in standby

- Fix call compatibility with conversations:
  * Conversation use Jingle Message Initiation for call setup - implement XEP-0353.
  * Add missing 'setup' attribute for fingerprint extension in jingle session-initiate: XEP-0320: Use of DTLS-SRTP in Jingle Sessions
    <fingerprint xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:apps:dtls:0' hash='sha-256' setup='actpass'/>
  * Conversations only accept setup.ACTPASS when aTalk is the initiator; Aborted when use setup.PASSIVE
  * Jingle session-initiate sid must be the same as the JingleMessage id, otherwise conversations will immediately terminate the call.
    Copy the JingleMessage id value to CallJabberImpl for use when creating session-initiate
  * Copy GroupExtension from session-initiate to session-accept - required by conversations
    Conversations v2.8.5 expects transport-info trailing session-accept, otherwise gives warning:
    W/conversations: hawk@atalk.sytes.net: no identification tags found in initial offer. we won't be able to calculate mLineIndices
    hawk@atalk.sytes.net: received unhandled jingle action session-info
  * conversations check for attributes ufrag and pwd in <transport/>; check unfrag (null) for space => error
    aTalk must include the same values as specified in session-accept transport-info
    <transport xmlns='urn:xmpp:jingle:transports:ice-udp:1' ufrag='aKw6' pwd='lMi0g0i9hPGJHPeb1TXlkZ9U'/>
  * Rejected by conversation with whitespace in value for <parameter name='imageattr' value='send * recv *'/>
    Negotiation of Generic Image Attributes in the Session Description Protocol (SDP); https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6236
    3.2.  Considerations
    3.2.1.  No imageattr in First Offer
    When the initial offer does not contain the 'imageattr' attribute, the rules in Section 3.1.1.2 require the attribute to be absent in the answer.
    Make aTalk compliance i.e. excluded 'imageattr' if none in the initial offer
  * Caller aTalk rejected: conversations failed with bouncyCastle certificate verification stage - illegal parameter:
    Certificate is signed with SignatureAlgorithm.ecdsa not supported by aTalk
    TlsServerImpl.getCertificateRequest to include ClientCertificateType.ecdsa_sign i.e:
    short[] certificateTypes = new short[]{ ClientCertificateType.rsa_sign, ClientCertificateType.dss_sign, ClientCertificateType.ecdsa_sign};
  * aTalk Video call with conversations cause conversations to crash for h264 codec:
     eu.siacs.conversations W/System.err: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: h264 is not a constant in org.webrtc.VideoCodecType
     When remove H264 from codec offer, aTalk is then able to send/received VP8 video without problem;
     However conversations still has problem decode and display VP8 video.
     Reason: aTalk hardware codec supported packetization-mode does not really match Conversations (no common codec): need more investigation
     a. send from aalk:
        <payload-type id='105' name='h264' clockrate='90000'>
          <parameter name='profile-level-id' value='42E01f'/>

        </payload-type>
  * OperationSetAutoAnswerJabberImpl: Auto-accept call if call accept via Jingle Message <accept/>

- jisti 2.11.5624/5611 compatibility (video call only work on 5611):
  * jitsi does not respect the setting of <rtcp-mux/> in transport-info, continues to send non rtcp-mux transport info
    aTalk will realign itself to jitsi non rtcp-mux after received first call from jitsi
  * DTLS encryption failed with "cannot export keying material without "extended_master_secret" when aTalk is a server
    Make aTalk backward compatible with jitsi

- Support call via JingleMessage protocol or legacy if peer does not support XEP-0353: Jingle Message Initiation
- Default Opus Codec with useinbandfec=1 and usedtx=0 in advertised transport-info
  Not in rfc7587 specification: opusFormatParams.put("minptime", "10"), so not advertised

- Ensure transport-info of session-accept must have the two attributes i.e. ufrag and pwd specified
  * IceUdpTransportManager#createTransportPacketExtension must set both the attribute values
  * IceUdpTransportManager#wrapupConnectivityEstablishment must not strip the two attributes if transport-info contains child elements

- aTalk cannot handle Jingle transport-info properly when sent separately from session-initialize; session-accept with trailing transport-info
  * Break processJingle() handler into Synchronized (callPeer == null) and Non-Synchronized (callPeer != null)
  * Conversations sends trailing audio/video transport one after another for session-initiate and session-accept.
    Merge session-initiate with trailing transport-info's before being processed by OperationSetBasicTelephonyJabberImpl#processJingle();
    otherwise need to synchronously execute OperationSetBasicTelephonyJabberImpl#processJingle() to completion before process trailing transport-info
  * Must not start generating/processing local transport candidates establishment, before remote transport-info are processed
    - causing problem hold local transport until remote has completed.
  * For session-accept, must consolidated both transport-info's i.e. audio & video before process;
    Otherwise Ice4j#Agent#pruneNonMatchedStreams() prune video component when process the audio transport-info => creating problem.

- Always enable <rtcp-mux/> mode for all calls.
- NotificationServiceImpl#checkDefaultAgainstLoadedNotification: allow update of PopupMessageAction with new setting (no default)
- Enhance NotificationService to support sub-category message Type for Notification event

- Fix RtpDescriptionExtension implementation errors:
  * RtcpmuxExtension is childElement of RtpDescriptionExtension and not IceUdpTransportExtension.
    XEP-0167: Jingle RTP Sessions 1.2.0 (2020-04-22) https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0167.html
    <rtcp-mux/> specifies the ability to multiplex RTP Data and Control Packets on a single port as described in RFC 5761 [13].
  * Multiplexing RTP Data and Control Packets on a Single Port (April 2010), also propose to be included in transport
    https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5761 (5.1.3. Interactions with ICE)
  * Fix incorrect ExtensionProvider specified for <description/>:<rtcp-mux/>
    ProviderManager.addExtensionProvider( RtcpmuxExtension.ELEMENT, RtpDescriptionExtension.NAMESPACE,
        new DefaultExtensionElementProvider<>(RtcpmuxExtension.class));
  * CallPeerMediaHandlerJabberImpl#processOffer() must check for rtcpmux in RtpDescriptionExtension i.e.
        boolean rtcpmux = false;
        if (!description.getChildExtensionsOfType(RtcpmuxExtension.class).isEmpty() ||
            !transport.getChildExtensionsOfType(RtcpmuxExtension.class).isEmpty()) {
            rtcpmux = true;
            getTransportManager().setRtcpmux(true);
        }
  * Add chileElement RtcpmuxExtension support in RtpDescriptionExtension
  * Add parameter RtcpMux in JingleUtils#createDescription() for <rtcp-mux/> inclusion

- Cleanup DtlsFingerprintExtension class removing obsoleted 'required' to confirm with
  XEP-0320: Use of DTLS-SRTP in Jingle Sessions 0.3.1 (2015-10-15).

- Android 10: incoming (audio or video) calls fail to wake android device in standby for ring tone alert.
  Need to implement full-screen intent to start an activity from the background (standby)

- srtp classes improvements
  * DtlsPacketTransformer#initializeSRTPTransformer: use notifyHandshakeComplete() callback to init
  * Report any handShaking alert if any via srtpListener.securityMessageReceived()
  * Ensure the actual srtp security status is used for VideoActivity() encryption for display
  * TlsServierImpl and TslCleintImple now use getSupportedCipherSuites() in bctls DefaultTls_xxx

- OTR not interoperable with pidgin
  * XEP-0201: Best Practices for Message Threads; recommended only but not implemented by pidgin
  * OperationSetBasicInstantMessagingJabberImpl#getThreadIDForAddress(); create one if none found

- NotificationHelper: Set all android notification channels' alert to have silent tone, as aTalk have its own event handler
- Default Opus JNIEncoder#useDtx to false; MediaUtils=>opusFormatParams.put("useinbandfec", "1");
- FFR: Prevent ChatRoomCreateDialog crash on newly installed aTalk where there is no local or server chatRoom.
- Port to smack library new MessageBuilder() replacing the deprecated new Message()
